# Socket Programming with python

This is jus the implementation of the Berkeley Sockets (TCP/IP) using python

This code sets up an echo server which will echo back the message sent by the client.

Docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#module-socket

## Dependecies:

I used the rich python library so as it can print with timestamps to see when the messeges where sent

To install rich run: 

> `python -m pip install rich`

## Instructions:

Run the echo-server file first then the echo-client, run them in different CLI instances
